opentopomap style but modified to optimize visibility of your own route,
to optimize your navigation experience.

All colors on the map except the roads are almost white, hopefully to maximize visibility
under bright viewing conditions. Also the colors are very bleaked out, to make
the navigation lines that are overlaid by the garmin stand out. 
The roads are mostly black, to make them well visible against the whitish map
yet staying away from bright colors of the navigation lines.

The original comes from https://github.com/der-stefan/OpenTopoMap/blob/master/garmin
