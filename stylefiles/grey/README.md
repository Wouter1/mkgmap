opentopomap style but modified to optimize visibility of your own route,
to optimize your navigation experience.

This map overall is a bit dark and with pale colors, so that your route 
stands out if you take a bright color (red, green, yellow, etc).
Also your turn-by-turn notifications will come out very clear.

The original comes from https://github.com/der-stefan/OpenTopoMap/blob/master/garmin
