opentopomap style but modified to optimize visibility of your own route,
to optimize your navigation experience.

The original isea is that this map overall is a bit dark and with 
pale colors, so that your route 
stands out if you take a bright color (red, green, yellow, etc).
Also your turn-by-turn notifications will come out very clear.

In practice, this style is less succesful. 
This mode might work in darker situations.
However in broad daylight the screen shows almost black, 
and this causes the environment (typically, blue sky)
to reflect too much. This blueish teint also makes it almost
impossible to see the purple lines of garmin's default navigation
lines.

The original comes from https://github.com/der-stefan/OpenTopoMap/blob/master/garmin
